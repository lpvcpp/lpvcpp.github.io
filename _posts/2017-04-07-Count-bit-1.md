## Description


Given a positive integer k, calculate the total number of 1s in the binary representations of all the numbers from 1 to k, inclusive.

Example

For k = 5, the output should be
totalOnes(k) = 7.

    110 = 12 => 1
    210 = 102 => 1
    310 = 112 => 2
    410 = 1002 => 1
    510 = 1012 => 2

Thus, the answer is 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 7.

Input/Output

    [time limit] 500ms (cpp)

    [input] integer k

    Guaranteed constraints:
    0 < k < 231.

    [output] integer64

    The total number of 1s in the binary representations of the numbers from 1 to k, inclusive.
