## Description


Given a positive integer k, calculate the total number of 1s in the binary representations of all the numbers from 1 to k, inclusive.

Example

For k = 5, the output should be
totalOnes(k) = 7.

    1 = 1 => 1
    2 = 10 => 1
    3 = 11 => 2
    4 = 100 => 1
    5 = 101 => 2

Thus, the answer is 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 7.

Input/Output

    [time limit] 500ms (cpp)

    [input] integer k

    Guaranteed constraints:
    0 < k < 231.

    [output] integer64

    The total number of 1s in the binary representations of the numbers from 1 to k, inclusive.

## Solution 
Step 1:
Now, for example, the input will be 13, and we will have a table of binary present of intergers from 0 to 13 like below:

        0   |   000
        1   |   001
        2   |   010
        3   |   011
        4   |   100
        5   |   101
        6   |   110
        7   |   111
        8   |   1000
        9   |   1001
        10  |   1010
        11  |   1011
        12  |   1100
        13  |   1101

Okay, now let's take a look from the numbers from 0 to 7. Easily, we can see the total number of 0s and 1s in binary present of numbers from 0 to 7 are 12 = 2^3\*3/2. Right?
So it's mean we can easily count the total of 1s in binary present of number from 1 to 7. 
~~~
int p;
p = log2(13);  // p = 3
total1s = pow(2,p)\*p/2; // total1s = 12
~~~
log2() function will help us to find out the biggest number smaller than k, which satisfy condition, all present of this number are 1s.

Step 2:
Now, we need find out the total numer of 1s in binary present of numbers from 8 to 13.
Easily again, we can see these number begin by 1s. So...

~~~
total1s += (13 - 8 ) + 1; // understood?
~~~

Then we repeat Step 1 with below table:

        8   |   ~~1~~000
        9   |   ~~1~~001
        10  |   ~~1~~010
        11  |   ~~1~~011
        12  |   ~~1~~100
        13  |   ~~1~~101
